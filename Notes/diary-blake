Created basic blog style website by following the Rails 7 guide in the group decisions file. This was a great
introduction to rails and how the file structure works.

Using https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/ for brushing up on html and css.

Made front end mock website for the dashboard to sit in. The website itself is not apart of the MVP but to show the
dashboard in a more realistic environment.

Created base dashboard design using plain html and css with flex boxes.

Redid front end with bootstrap front end for easier mobile styling and dashboard layout. Using the
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/ website for reference and help.

Redesign of inputs to look more user friendly.

Redid structure of dashboard to have nested col and row for easier auto scaling.

Got auto div refresh working by re-rendering sections of the dashboard. Based on a one second timer through
Javascript setInterval().

Implemented battery arrow flipping based on charging or discharging battery.

First round of user testing went okay. Battery needs to be reworked to more easily explain its state.
Rephrasing a few things to make them more clear. Next set of testing planned for one week from now.

Implemented charging and discharging labels for battery that its color changes based on state. Also added
labels to other inputs for renewable or non-renewable. Added a last updated time stamp similar to the
one from the blog introduction project.

Set up paths for graphs page linking. Currently sending the microgrid information based on id. Might have
to change in the future to access more than that one row for data history.
