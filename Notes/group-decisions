Using Jekyll and Rails for project.

Dropping Jekyll to make a dynamic cite with rails.

Rough Prototype goal of first formal presentation February 22, 2022.

Got a rough design of the dashboard layout for first formal.

Decided to use bootstrap for front end as it is common to use with rails and for easier mobile layout.

Goal of MVP by second formal presentation March 29, 2022.

Met MVP goal, still some work to be done such as auto refresh and user testing.

First user testing set for April 2, 2022.

Changing some names and layout based on user testing problems/misunderstandings.

Second set of user testing planned for April 12-13, 2022. This would be done in the Wood Center to get a
larger variety of people to answer questions. Goal is to have it launched to Heroku to be able to test a
large variety of devices as well.

Did user testing on the 13th and had 12 people take part in testing.

Changed the structure of the github to Heroku and Local. Heroku runs the Postgres data base and Local runs SQLite3.

Going to be getting a paid Heroku account to host the ruby daemon file and the website. MQTT broker will be run on a seperate machine.
